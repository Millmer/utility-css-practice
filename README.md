# Utility First CSS Design Pattern Practice

The goal of this project is to practice creating and using the css design pattern known as `utiliy first`. This enables rapid front end development by creating small re-usable CSS classes with semantic naming.

In order to acheive this goal the Trello web application was used as a base.

The project uses just vanilla CSS and HTML with PostCSS to compile all css files to a single distribution.

# Future Goals
